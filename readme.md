# Filmz

Maintaining my films and series. The ones I saw as well as the ones I want to see.

Data that I want to keep for a film:
* Title
* Year
* Genre (potentially multiple can apply)
* Rating (1-10) of ME
* Rating (1-10) of IMDB
* Poster (link to URL of IMDB)
* Description (from IMDB, maybe edited by me)
* Trailer (link to IMDB Trailer)
* Country (from IMDB maybe edited by me)
* Language (from IMDB maybe edited by me)
* Release Date (from IMDB)
* Runtime (from IMDB)
* Plot (from IMDB maybe edited by me)

Around sharing
* Who recommended me this film
* For who is this film. I.e. "Me alone", "Me and partner", "Family"

Functionality:
* Search, add, edit, delete a film
* Share a film

## Setup / Run / Build 

In order to build a package to publish go on `Product > Archive` and then `Distribute App`.
To *distribute* it the App I currently use TestFlight. Use [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com) to upload the app and see what has been uploaded in the past.

## Roadmap

Features in no specific order:

* Fix the search capabilities. Thx to Sergio: Add a "*" at the end.
* Disallow adding the same movie twice.
* Add rating from IMDB and from the user.
* Share a movie with a friend.

Technical playgrounds & toys on my list:

* Use Windsurf in order to compare it to cursor ai
* use Google AI Studio to work on the logo
